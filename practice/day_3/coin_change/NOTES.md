# Please explain to me how this line works

```go
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
```

## Answer

This line is a key part of the dynamic programming solution for the Coin Change problem. Let's break it down step by step:

```go
dp[i] = int(math.Min(float64(dp[i]), float64(dp[i-coin]+1)))
```

1. Purpose of the line:
   This line updates the minimum number of coins needed to make the amount `i`, considering the current coin denomination we're processing.

2. Components:
   - `dp[i]`: The current minimum number of coins needed to make amount `i`.
   - `dp[i - coin]`: The minimum number of coins needed to make the amount `i - coin`.
   - `dp[i - coin] + 1`: The number of coins needed if we use the current coin plus the optimal solution for the remaining amount.

3. How it works:
   - We're comparing two values:
     1. `dp[i]`: The current best solution we've found so far for amount `i`.
     2. `dp[i - coin] + 1`: The solution we'd get if we use the current coin plus the best solution for the remaining amount.
   - We take the minimum of these two values, which gives us the optimal solution considering the current coin.

4. Example:
   Let's say we're trying to make amount 7 with coins [1, 2, 5], and we're currently processing the coin 5:
   - Before this line, `dp[7]` might be 7 (using seven 1-cent coins).
   - `dp[7 - 5]` is `dp[2]`, which is 2 (two 1-cent coins).
   - So we're comparing:
     - Current solution: 7 coins
     - New potential solution: `dp[2] + 1` = 2 + 1 = 3 coins (one 5-cent coin plus the best way to make 2 cents)
   - We choose the minimum: 3, which becomes the new value for `dp[7]`.

5. Iterative improvement:
   As we process each coin for each amount, we continuously improve our solution, ensuring that `dp[i]` always holds the minimum number of coins needed for amount `i` considering all coins processed so far.

This line encapsulates the core idea of the dynamic programming approach: we build optimal solutions for larger amounts by combining optimal solutions for smaller amounts with the coins we have available.
