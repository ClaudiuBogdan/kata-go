# How does this operation works on a go slice

```go
arr[1:3]
```

## Answer

In Go, the operation `arr[1:3]` is called slicing. It creates a new slice that references a portion of an existing array or slice. Let's break it down:

1. Syntax: `arr[low:high]`
   - `arr` is the source array or slice
   - `low` is the starting index (inclusive)
   - `high` is the ending index (exclusive)

2. For `arr[1:3]`:
   - It creates a new slice starting from index 1 (second element) up to, but not including, index 3.
   - The resulting slice will contain elements at indices 1 and 2 of the original array.

3. Example:

   ```go
   arr := []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   newSlice := arr[1:3]
   // newSlice now contains [1, 2]
   ```

4. Important points:
   - The original array is not copied. The new slice is a view into the original array.
   - Modifying elements in the new slice will affect the original array.
   - The length of the new slice is `high - low` (in this case, 3 - 1 = 2).
   - The capacity of the new slice extends from `low` to the end of the underlying array.

5. Omitting indices:
   - If you omit `low`, it defaults to 0: `arr[:3]` is the same as `arr[0:3]`
   - If you omit `high`, it defaults to the length of the slice: `arr[1:]` gives all elements from index 1 to the end

6. Memory efficiency:
   - Slicing is a very efficient operation as it doesn't copy the data.
   - However, be aware that the original array can't be garbage collected as long as any slice referencing it exists.

This slicing operation is very powerful and commonly used in Go for tasks like:

- Extracting a portion of an array or slice
- Creating views into different parts of the same underlying data
- Implementing efficient algorithms that work on subsets of data

Understanding slicing is crucial for effective Go programming, especially when working with arrays and slices.
