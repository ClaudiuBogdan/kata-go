# Notes

**1. Code Analysis:**

- Strength: Your implementation of the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithm using recursion is concise and follows the correct logic for traversing a binary tree.
- Strength: The base case handling (root == nil || root == p || root == q) is correct and efficient.
- Improvement: Consider adding comments to explain the logic behind each step of the algorithm, especially for the recursive calls and the decision-making process.

**2. Concept Explanation:**
The Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) problem in a binary tree is like finding the most recent common relative in a family tree. Imagine you're at a family reunion, and you want to find the closest relative that two people share. You start from the oldest known ancestor (the root of the tree) and work your way down.

In this algorithm, we're using a bottom-up approach. It's like asking each person in the family tree, "Do you know these two people?" If they say "Yes" to both, they might be the LCA. If they say "Yes" to one and point you to another branch for the other, you need to go up and ask their parent.

**3. Hints & Questions:**

1. What happens if one of the nodes (p or q) is not present in the tree? How would your current implementation handle this case?
2. Can you think of a way to improve the efficiency of your algorithm if you knew that both p and q are guaranteed to be in the tree?
3. How would you modify your function to return not just the LCA node, but also whether both p and q were found in the tree?

**4. Helpful Tips:**

1. When working with recursive algorithms, it's often helpful to draw out the recursion tree on paper. This can help you visualize the flow of the algorithm and catch any potential issues.
2. Always consider edge cases when implementing tree algorithms. Some important ones to consider are: empty tree, when p or q is the root, when p is an ancestor of q (or vice versa), and when p or q (or both) are not in the tree.

## More Detailed Notes

1. What happens if one of the nodes (p or q) is not present in the tree? How would your current implementation handle this case?

In the current implementation, if one of the nodes (p or q) is not present in the tree, the function will still return a node, but it might not be the correct LCA. Specifically:

- If only one node (p or q) is present, the function will return that node.
- If neither p nor q is present, the function will return nil.

This behavior occurs because the function doesn't explicitly check if both nodes are present in the tree. It assumes that if a node matching p or q is found, it's the correct node, which might not always be the case.

2. Can you think of a way to improve the efficiency of your algorithm if you knew that both p and q are guaranteed to be in the tree?

If we know for certain that both p and q are in the tree, we could potentially improve efficiency by:

- Early termination: Once we've found both p and q, we could immediately return the current node as the LCA without continuing to search the rest of the tree.
- Pruning: If we find p or q in one subtree, we don't need to search for that same node in the other subtree.

Here's a sketch of how this might look:

```go
func LowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q *TreeNode) *TreeNode {
    if root == nil || root == p || root == q {
        return root
    }

    left := LowestCommonAncestor(root.Left, p, q)
    if left != nil && left != p && left != q {
        return left  // LCA found in left subtree
    }

    right := LowestCommonAncestor(root.Right, p, q)
    if right != nil && right != p && right != q {
        return right  // LCA found in right subtree
    }

    if left != nil && right != nil {
        return root  // p and q are in different subtrees
    }

    if left != nil {
        return left
    }
    return right
}
```

3. How would you modify your function to return not just the LCA node, but also whether both p and q were found in the tree?

To achieve this, we can modify the function to return a custom struct that includes both the LCA node and a boolean indicating whether both p and q were found. Here's an example of how this could be implemented:

```go
type Result struct {
    node         *TreeNode
    pFound, qFound bool
}

func LowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q *TreeNode) (*TreeNode, bool) {
    result := lcaHelper(root, p, q)
    return result.node, result.pFound && result.qFound
}

func lcaHelper(root, p, q *TreeNode) Result {
    if root == nil {
        return Result{nil, false, false}
    }

    if root == p && root == q {
        return Result{root, true, true}
    }

    left := lcaHelper(root.Left, p, q)
    if left.pFound && left.qFound {
        return left
    }

    right := lcaHelper(root.Right, p, q)
    if right.pFound && right.qFound {
        return right
    }

    result := Result{root, left.pFound || right.pFound || root == p, left.qFound || right.qFound || root == q}

    if result.pFound && result.qFound {
        return result
    }

    if left.node != nil {
        return left
    }
    return right
}
```

This modification allows the function to accurately report whether both p and q were found in the tree, which is particularly useful when you're not certain if both nodes exist in the tree.
