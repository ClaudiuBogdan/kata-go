# Can you explain this section to me in more detail?

```go
for i := n - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
```

## Answer

Certainly! This line is a key part of the DFS implementation, and it's worth explaining in detail.

This for loop is iterating over the adjacent vertices of the current vertex v in reverse order. Let's break it down:

```n``` is the slice of adjacent vertices for vertex v.
```n - 1``` is the index of the last element in this slice.
The loop starts from this last index and goes backwards to 0.
Now, why do we iterate in reverse order? There are two main reasons:

Stack behavior: In DFS, we use a stack to keep track of vertices to visit. By pushing adjacent vertices onto the stack in reverse order, we ensure that when we pop from the stack, we'll get the vertices in their original order. This isn't strictly necessary for correctness, but it can make the traversal order more intuitive.
Consistency with recursive DFS: If you were to implement DFS recursively, you'd naturally explore the first adjacent vertex first, then the second, and so on. By pushing vertices onto the stack in reverse order, we mimic this behavior in our iterative implementation.
Here's a step-by-step example:

Let's say for vertex 5, we have g.AdjList[5] = [2, 3, 7].

The loop will do the following:

Push 7 onto the stack
Push 3 onto the stack
Push 2 onto the stack
Now, when we pop from the stack in subsequent iterations, we'll get 2, then 3, then 7 - the same order as in the adjacency list.

If we didn't reverse the order, we'd push 2, then 3, then 7, and when popping we'd explore 7, then 3, then 2 - reverse of what we might expect.

This reversal ensures that our iterative DFS explores vertices in an order consistent with what you'd expect from a recursive implementation or from the order in the adjacency list.

Is there any part of this explanation you'd like me to elaborate on further?
