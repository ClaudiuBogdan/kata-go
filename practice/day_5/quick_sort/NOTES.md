# Lesson

1. Pivot Selection in QuickSort:
   - Crucial for algorithm performance
   - Poor choices can lead to O(n^2) worst-case complexity

2. Key Pivot Selection Strategies:
   - Last element (simple, but risky for sorted arrays)
   - Random element (avoids worst-case scenarios)
   - Median-of-three (good balance of simplicity and performance)

3. Median-of-Three Implementation:

```go
func medianOfThree(arr []int, low, high int) int {
    mid := low + (high - low) / 2
    a, b, c := arr[low], arr[mid], arr[high]
    
    if (a <= b && b <= c) || (c <= b && b <= a) {
        return mid
    } else if (b <= a && a <= c) || (c <= a && a <= b) {
        return low
    } else {
        return high
    }
}
```

4. Random Pivot Implementation:

```go
import (
    "math/rand"
    "time"
)

var rng = rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))

func partition(arr []int, low, high int) int {
    pivotIndex := low + rng.Intn(high-low+1)
    arr[pivotIndex], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[pivotIndex]
    
    pivotValue := arr[high]
    i := low - 1

    for j := low; j < high; j++ {
        if arr[j] <= pivotValue {
            i++
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
        }
    }

    arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]
    return i + 1
}
```

5. Benefits of Random Pivot:
   - Helps avoid worst-case scenarios
   - Good balance of simplicity and performance
   - Particularly useful for sorted or nearly sorted inputs

6. Important Go-specific Note:
   - Slices are reference types, so using pointers to slices is unnecessary

These notes capture the main concepts and provide the most relevant code snippets for implementing different pivot selection strategies in QuickSort.

```go
 // practice/day_5/quick_sort/quick_sort.go (1-36)
 package quicksort

 // QuickSort performs quick sort on a slice of integers
 func QuickSort(arr []int) []int {
  quickSort(&arr, 0, len(arr)-1)
  return arr
 }

 func quickSort(arr *[]int, low int, high int) {
  if low = high {
   return
  }
  partitionIdx := partition(arr, low, high)
  quickSort(arr, low, partitionIdx-1)
  quickSort(arr, partitionIdx+1, high)
 }

 func partition(arrPointer *[]int, low int, high int) int {
  // We get the high as the partition index
  arr :=*arrPointer
  partitionValue := arr[high]

  idx := low - 1
 
  for i := low; i <= high; i++ {
   if arr[i] <= partitionValue {
    idx++
    arr[i], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[i]
   }
  }
  idx++
  arr[idx], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[idx]
 
  return idx
 }

 ```

### _Assistant_

 After analyzing the student's code, here are the key observations:

 1. Potential bug: In the partition function, the loop runs from low to high inclusive (i <= high). This is incorrect and may lead to unnecessary comparisons. It should be i < high.

 2. Improvement area: The code uses pointers unnecessarily. In Go, slices are already reference types, so using pointers to slices is redundant and can be simplified.

 3. Efficiency: The algorithm's efficiency is generally good (O(n log n) average case), but the choice of pivot (always the last element) can lead to worst-case O(n^2) performance for already sorted or reverse sorted arrays.

 4. Edge cases: The code handles the base case correctly (low = high), but it doesn't explicitly check for empty or nil slices, which could be added for robustness.

 To improve the code, the student should fix the partition loop condition, remove unnecessary pointer usage, and consider implementing a better pivot selection strategy (e.g., median-of-three).

### _User_

 I want to understand more about the choice of the pivot. How I should select the pivot?

### _Assistant_

 Certainly! The choice of pivot is crucial in QuickSort as it significantly affects the algorithm's performance. Here are some common strategies for selecting a pivot:

 1. Last element (current implementation):
    - Simple, but can lead to worst-case performance on sorted or nearly sorted arrays.

 2. First element:
    - Also simple, but has the same drawbacks as the last element.

 3. Random element:
    - Chooses a random index as pivot.
    - Helps avoid worst-case scenarios but adds randomness to performance.

 4. Median-of-three:
    - Selects the median of the first, middle, and last elements.
    - Often a good balance between simplicity and performance.

 5. Median-of-medians:
    - More complex but guarantees O(n log n) worst-case performance.
    - Rarely used in practice due to implementation complexity.

 For most practical purposes, the median-of-three method is a good choice. It's relatively simple to implement and provides good performance in most cases. Here's how you could modify the partition function to use median-of-three:

 ```go
 func medianOfThree(arr []int, low, high int) int {
     mid := low + (high - low) / 2
     a, b, c := arr[low], arr[mid], arr[high]
     
     if (a <= b && b <= c) || (c <= b && b <= a) {
         return mid
     } else if (b <= a && a <= c) || (c <= a && a <= b) {
         return low
     } else {
         return high
     }
 }
 
 func partition(arr []int, low, high int) int {
     pivotIndex := medianOfThree(arr, low, high)
     arr[pivotIndex], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[pivotIndex]
     
     // Rest of the partition function remains the same
     // ...
 }
 ```

 This modification selects the median of the first, middle, and last elements as the pivot, which helps to avoid worst-case scenarios in many common situations.

### _User_

 How would the code look like with a random pivot?

### _Assistant_

 Certainly! Here's how you could modify the QuickSort implementation to use a random pivot selection strategy:

 ```go
 package quicksort
 
 import (
     "math/rand"
     "time"
 )
 
 // Initialize the random number generator
 var rng = rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))
 
 // QuickSort performs quick sort on a slice of integers
 func QuickSort(arr []int) []int {
     quickSort(arr, 0, len(arr)-1)
     return arr
 }
 
 func quickSort(arr []int, low, high int) {
     if low < high {
         pivotIndex := partition(arr, low, high)
         quickSort(arr, low, pivotIndex-1)
         quickSort(arr, pivotIndex+1, high)
     }
 }
 
 func partition(arr []int, low, high int) int {
     // Choose a random pivot
     pivotIndex := low + rng.Intn(high-low+1)
     
     // Swap the pivot with the last element
     arr[pivotIndex], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[pivotIndex]
     
     pivotValue := arr[high]
     i := low - 1
 
     for j := low; j < high; j++ {
         if arr[j] <= pivotValue {
             i++
             arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
         }
     }
 
     arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]
     return i + 1
 }
 ```

 Key changes in this implementation:

 1. We import the `math/rand` package and `time` package to generate random numbers.

 2. We initialize a random number generator (`rng`) with a seed based on the current time. This ensures that we get different random sequences each time the program runs.

 3. In the `partition` function, we select a random pivot index using `rng.Intn(high-low+1)` to get a random number between 0 and `high-low`, then add `low` to shift it to the correct range.

 4. We swap this randomly selected pivot with the last element before proceeding with the partition process as before.

 5. The rest of the algorithm remains the same.

 This random pivot selection helps to avoid worst-case scenarios that can occur with fixed pivot selection strategies (like always choosing the first or last element) when the input is sorted or nearly sorted. It provides a good balance of simplicity and performance for most practical use cases.
