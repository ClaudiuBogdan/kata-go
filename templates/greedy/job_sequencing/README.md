# Greedy Algorithm for Job Sequencing Problem

## Problem Description

The Job Sequencing Problem involves scheduling a set of jobs to maximize profit. Each job has a deadline and an associated profit. The goal is to schedule as many jobs as possible before their deadlines to maximize the total profit. Only one job can be scheduled at a time, and each job takes one unit of time to complete.

## Approach

This implementation uses a greedy algorithm to solve the Job Sequencing Problem. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Sort all jobs in decreasing order of profit.
2. Initialize the result sequence with 'empty' slots.
3. For each job in the sorted order:
   a. Find the latest empty slot before or at its deadline.
   b. If found, schedule the job in that slot.

This greedy approach ensures that we always consider the most profitable jobs first and schedule them as late as possible within their deadlines.

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of jobs. This is due to the nested loop in scheduling jobs.
- Space Complexity: O(m), where m is the maximum deadline among all jobs.

## Usage

```go
jobs := []Job{
    {ID: 1, Deadline: 2, Profit: 100},
    {ID: 2, Deadline: 1, Profit: 19},
    {ID: 3, Deadline: 2, Profit: 27},
    {ID: 4, Deadline: 1, Profit: 25},
    {ID: 5, Deadline: 3, Profit: 15},
}

schedule := ScheduleJobs(jobs)
totalProfit := CalculateTotalProfit(jobs, schedule)

fmt.Println("Scheduled jobs:", schedule)
fmt.Println("Total profit:", totalProfit)
```

## Implementation Details

The package provides the following main components:

1. `Job` struct: Represents a job with its ID, deadline, and profit.
2. `ScheduleJobs(jobs []Job) []int`: Schedules jobs to maximize profit and returns the sequence of job IDs.
3. `CalculateTotalProfit(jobs []Job, schedule []int) int`: Calculates the total profit of the scheduled jobs.

The implementation uses Go's built-in `sort` package to sort jobs by profit in descending order.

## Testing

The implementation includes a test suite that covers various scenarios:

1. Simple case with a mix of jobs
2. All jobs can be scheduled
3. Some jobs cannot be scheduled due to deadline conflicts
4. Empty input
5. Single job

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
go test
```

The test file uses Go's built-in testing package and includes multiple test cases to ensure the correctness of the job sequencing implementation under different scenarios.

## Advantages and Limitations

Advantages:
- Efficiently schedules jobs to maximize profit
- Simple to understand and implement
- Works well for most practical scenarios

Limitations:
- May not always produce the optimal solution (but generally produces a good approximation)
- The O(n^2) time complexity may not be suitable for very large datasets
- Assumes that all jobs take the same amount of time to complete

## Applications

- Task scheduling in operating systems
- Project management and resource allocation
- Production planning in manufacturing
- Appointment scheduling in healthcare
- Event planning and management

Remember that while this greedy approach works well for the basic Job Sequencing Problem, more complex scheduling problems with additional constraints may require different algorithms or modifications to this approach.
