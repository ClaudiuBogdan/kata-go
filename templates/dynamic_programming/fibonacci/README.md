# Fibonacci Sequence Generation (Dynamic Programming Solution)

## Problem Description

Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms and calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

## Approach

This solution uses dynamic programming to generate the Fibonacci sequence and calculate individual terms efficiently.

### Algorithm Steps for Generating Sequence:

1. Initialize a dp array of size n.
2. Set dp[0] = 0 and dp[1] = 1 as base cases.
3. Iterate from 2 to n-1:
   - Set dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
4. Return the dp array containing the Fibonacci sequence.

### Algorithm Steps for Calculating nth Term:

1. Handle base cases for n <= 2.
2. Use two variables to store the previous two terms.
3. Iterate from 3 to n, updating the variables.
4. Return the final calculated term.

## Complexity Analysis

For generating the sequence:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of terms.
- Space Complexity: O(n) to store the sequence.

For calculating the nth term:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the term number.
- Space Complexity: O(1), using only two variables.

## Usage

```go
// Generate Fibonacci sequence
sequence := GenerateFibonacci(10)
fmt.Println(sequence) // Output: [0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34]

// Calculate nth Fibonacci term
nthTerm := FibonacciTerm(10)
fmt.Println(nthTerm) // Output: 34
```

## Implementation Details

The package provides two main functions:

1. `GenerateFibonacci(n int) []int`: Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
2. `FibonacciTerm(n int) int`: Calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Testing

The implementation includes a test suite that covers various scenarios:

1. Generating sequences of different lengths
2. Calculating specific Fibonacci terms
3. Edge cases (e.g., n = 0, n = 1)

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
go test
```

## Advantages of Dynamic Programming

- Efficient: Avoids redundant calculations by storing previously computed values.
- Scalable: Can handle large n values without excessive time or space complexity.
- Versatile: The same approach can be adapted for various Fibonacci-related problems.

## Applications

- Financial modeling and prediction
- Natural phenomena modeling (e.g., spiral patterns in nature)
- Algorithm analysis and design
- Computer science education and interview preparation

This dynamic programming solution for Fibonacci sequence generation and term calculation provides an efficient and scalable approach to a classic computer science problem, with potential applications in various fields of study and practical scenarios.
